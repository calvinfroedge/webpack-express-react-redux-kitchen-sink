# Everything but the kitchen sink for your React project

I started with [webpack-express-boilerplate](https://github.com/christianalfoni/webpack-express-boilerplate) and added [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux), ES7 support, LESS support.

**NOTE!** Use the latest version of Node, 4.x.x.

## Install and Running

1. cd webpack-express-boilerplate
2. npm install
3. npm start
4. navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your browser of choice.
