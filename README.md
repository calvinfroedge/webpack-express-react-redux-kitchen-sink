# Everything but the kitchen sink for your React project

I started with [webpack-express-boilerplate](https://github.com/christianalfoni/webpack-express-boilerplate) and added [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux), ES7 support, LESS support, [Authentication via Auth0](https://auth0.com/), and several useful widgets for building web apps. Working on adding more, and will abstract into distinct libraries.

**NOTE!** Use the latest version of Node, 4.x.x.

## Install and Running
`git clone https://github.com/christianalfoni/webpack-express-boilerplate.git`

or just export the files:

`svn export https://github.com/christianalfoni/webpack-express-boilerplate/trunk ./dir`

1. cd webpack-express-boilerplate
2. npm install
3. npm start
4. navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your browser of choice.
